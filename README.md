## British++


# What's british++?
British ++, is a JIT compiler, which creates a customized bytecode.

As how you run this bytecode is via a interpreter, which other machines can use aswell to compile.


# Why is it named British++
It is named british not because it looks like any High Level programming language

It's because it's an inside joke with some of my friends.

# Why did I create this
This was just a original meme, which I created into reality to pass the time.

# How can I use this?
This will be as simple as running any js code with node.

# Any docs?
Not right now since it's still in development

# When will it come out
As of writing this I'm recreating it, and I'm making the lexer.

Soon though.
